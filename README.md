# CV-Snippets
Here resides real snippets of the projects done by me while working as a Django backend developer and Angular front-end developer  
I'll try to keep this repository updated  
- Note: **My employers are informed about every snippet I put here and permissions are always granted beforehand**
- Note: **These snippets are selected in a way to avoid revealing existing vulnerabilities or disclosing the key ideas. So they are rather common codes introducing my ways of coding for curious future employers. Although, any misuse (any use other than employment procedures) is not permitted.**
